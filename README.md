### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antonio. I am 23 years old. I am a full time as a Machine
Learning Framework Engineer at [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/)! I
have previously done internships as a machine learning engineer and data
scientist at [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/),
[Yelp](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yelp-com), [Kik](https://www.kik.com/),
and [Capital One](https://www.linkedin.com/company/capital-one)

As part of my work, I am actively contributing to both the
[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [Torch-MLIR
(LLVM)](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir) projects

On the side,
- ðŸ”­ I recently worked on a deep Generative Adversarial Network that can
  generate high quality images of deep space (comparable to the Hubble eXtreme
  Deep Field).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any exciting cutting edge machine learning
  projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience working in the machine learning/data science
  field
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me on
  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniojkim/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am classically trained on the piano ðŸŽ¹
